https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming

> Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer. The program is also viewed as a hypertext document, rather like the World Wide Web.

  - Polymode is actually amazing

Similar concepts:

- Hugo shortcodes
- Pandoc filters
- Jinja
- Preprocessors of Markdown
- Interpreted fenced code blocks
- Org-mode
  - Babel is Org-mode's ability to execute source code within Org-mode
    documents. Probably the most ergonomic literate programming
    environment. But requires the user to learn and use Emacs.
